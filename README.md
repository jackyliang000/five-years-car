# five-years-car
this is the car moving project

1.启动 FiveyearcarApplication,访问 http://localhost:8080/dimension

Start FiveyearcarApplication, visit http: // localhost: 8080 / dimension

2.在setting dimension页面中分别在两个输入框中输入x的数值与y的数值以确定dimension的size

Enter the value of x and the value of y in the two input boxes on the Setting Dimension page to determine the size of the dimension

3.点击提交,进入到Car页面,在Car页面中有两个按钮(前进,转弯),分别可以操纵汽车向目前的车头方向前进一个和向顺时针转动一个方向,汽车初始地方位于(1,1)

Click Submit to enter the Car page. There are two buttons in the Car page (forward and turn), which can be used to move the car forward one direction and clockwise one direction, 
and the initial place of the car is at (1,1)

4.每一次操纵汽车后,页面会打印出汽车操纵后的结果,包括操纵信息(前进成功,转弯成功,因越出边界无法前进),当前汽车所在位置的x轴坐标以及y轴坐标,
当前汽车车头所对的方向(east,south,west,north),以及汽车方位的大致草图(0-空位,C-汽车所在位置)
Each time the car is manipulated, the page will print the results of the car's manipulation, including the manipulation information (successful forward, successful turn, unable to advance due to crossing the boundary), x-axis coordinates and y-axis coordinates of the current car location,
The direction of the current car heading (east, south, west, north),and a rough sketch of the car's orientation (0-vacant, C-car location)
